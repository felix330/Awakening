Description=After spending many hours working with the VXAce RTP tileset I have essentially come to the conclusion that I don't much care for it and have begun an attempt at converting the XP RTP tileset to the VX Ace format.%n%%n%This is no doubt going to be a long and tedious process as I cannot find any reasonable tool for converting the XP tiles to VX format [largely due to different autotile size].%n%%n%If anybody out there is very good with GIMP script it could probably be scripted--%n%%n%Hopefully not illegal, if so just piss and moan and have it removed.%n%%n%Other updates coming soon, hopefully I can get the majority of the tiles... I personally think they look much better and wonder why they opted for the super square look... it doesn't work well with landscapes.%n%%n%This is a work in progress, some tiles might not work pixel perfect... most of this is due to the change in autotile size from 96 x 128 to 64 x 96. Go figure. Enjoy.%n%%n%First time using the workshop and while I believe the tiles are correctly included I am not positive... so if you download this and get nothing but the default tiles do let me know so I can begin the process of figuring out how to appropriately include them.%n%%n%This is no doubt going to be a long and tedious process as I cannot find any reasonable tool for converting the XP tiles to VX format [largely due to different autotile size].%n%%n%If anybody out there is very good with GIMP script it could probably be scripted--%n%%n%Hopefully not illegal, if so just piss and moan and have it removed.%n%%n%Other updates coming soon, hopefully I can get the majority of the tiles...
